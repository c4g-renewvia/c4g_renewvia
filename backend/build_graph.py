    Builds a directed graph for use in finding a minimum-cost arborescence given

    This function constructs a directed graph where poles and terminals are represented

    and voltage attributes are applied to the edges depending on their type (pole-to-terminal,
    pole-to-pole, or source-to-pole/terminal connections).
